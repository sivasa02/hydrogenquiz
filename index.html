        </div>
        <p> A)The world's largest facility for producing hydrogen fuel is claimed to be the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field (FH2R), a 10MW-class hydrogen production unit, inaugurated on 7 March 2020</p>
        <div>
          <p>What are the two most common ways to produce hydrogen gas used in fuel cells?</p>
          <p>A) Steam reforming and electrolysis<br><br>B) Thermal conductivity <br> <br>C) Electromagnetism and quantum mechanics <br><br>D) Electrolysis and absorption</p>
          </div>
          <p>A) Since hydrogen does not exist as a gas on Earth, it must be separated from other elements. Hydrogen atoms can be separated from water, natural gas molecules or biomass. The two most common ways to produce hydrogen are steam reforming (using high-temperature steam to produce hydrogen from natural gas) and electrolysis (splitting water)..</p>

      <div>
        <p>Largest disadvantage of Solid oxide fuel cell</p>

        </div>
        <p>   D) The largest disadvantage is the high operating temperature which results in longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues</p>

        <div>
          <p>Test of typically several thousand cycles of charging/emptying(Hydrogen tanks)</p>
          <p>A) Leak test <br><br>B) Bonfire test <br> <br>C) Fatigue test <br><br>D) Burst test</p>

            <p> Hydrogen sensor test is also called</p>
            <p>A)  Accumulation test <br><br>B) Selection test <br> <br> C)Sniffing test<br><br>D) Detection test</p>
            </div>
            <p>C) Hyfrogen sensor test is also called sniffing test
            </p>

            <p> Hydrogen can be stored</p>
            <p>A)  Crystalline tubes <br><br>B) Gold coated metal tubes <br> <br> C) Carbon nano fibers tubes<br><br>D) Heavy steel tubes</p>
            </div>
            <p>C) Metal hydride storage of hydrogen is possible. However, weight constraints currently limit the potential range of a vehicle with this particular hydrogen storage technology. Carbon nanofibers or tubes as hydrogen storage also have been proposed; however, this technology is far from commercial development.

      <div>
        <p>In general, how much hydrogen is produced in the United States every year?</p>
        <p>A)  10 million metric tons <br><br>B) 200,000 metric tons <br> <br> C) 100 million metric tons<br><br>D) 2 million metric tons</p>
        </div>
        <p>A)  Hydrogen is a standard industrial chemical commodity today. In the United States, approximately 10 million metric tons of hydrogen are produced every year, most of which is used for petroleum recovery and refining purposes as well as fertilizer (ammonia)
